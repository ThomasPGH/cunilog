// **NOTE:** In case when the mutex appears to be uncreated,
// this function becomes *non-thread-safe*. If multiple threads
// call it at one moment, there occur several race conditions,
// in which one call might recreate another's shared memory
// object or rewrite another's pthread mutex in the shared memory.
// There is no workaround currently, except to run first
// initialization only before multi-threaded or multi-process
// functionality.

// only be available to other processes using it right now,
// but also to any process which might want to use it later on.
